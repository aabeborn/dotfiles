# My personal pc configuration

This is my personal pc configuration. It is based on nixos and uses flakes.
**Important!** This configuration works only on darwin systems.(MacOS) with Apple Silicon chips.

## Features

- Base MacOS configuration (in a declarative wayðŸ¤©).
- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) with all the packages I need, like UI Applications, CLI tools and fonts.
- [Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) as dotfile manager

## Installation

1. Clone this repository on your $HOME directory.
2. Add right permissions to files

```sh
chmod 777 ./scripts/*
```

3. Run the setup script

```sh
./scripts/setup.sh
```

## Usage

`setup.sh` is the only and right way to use the repo. it handles different actions:

- `Install`: Setup the pc
- `Uninstall`: Reset all to base configuration
- `Reset Mac Preferences`: Reset to default all properties
- `Refresh dotfiles`: Refresh all dotifles
- `Update`: update all apps
